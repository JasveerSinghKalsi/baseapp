# Base App

A cookbook for creating a base for an application where authentication methods are configured using Firebase and Flutter Bloc

## Firebase

In this project, Firebase is used to configure the authentication methods to login, create account and verification.

## Flutter Bloc

Bloc State Management is used to separate the business logic from the application UI. Credits to https://github.com/vandadnp for creating the best flutter bloc state management course.
